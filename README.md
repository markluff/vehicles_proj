 Sprint 4 project

 In this project I conduct some preliminary data analyis on a US Vehicles csv file. Then I develop an interactive web app using streamlit in order to look more closely at the data. 
 In the EDA file, I took the content of the csv and cleaned up the data and added a Manufacturers column as that is a common way for people to think about their vehicles. I then made a few different charts to explore the data more in depth. These charts can be used to bring up new questions that will help with further analysis of the dataset.

 The app.py file will take the user to a new tab on their browser. There is an interactive chart of the Vehicle types made by each manufacture. There is also a scatterplot chart comparing the price vs milage and condition of the vehicle. I also added a checkbox to look just at luxury cars or to look only at non-luxury vehicles. I thought this woud be an interesting checkbox as many consumers would like to compare similar types of vehicles and I thought that by having the two data sets separated it would allow for a more honest comparison of the vehicles in the data set.

 To launch this app, the user will need to save the file into a directory and then from their command prompt type: streamlit run app.py  
 By typing this command the program will automatically open a new tab with this program running.
